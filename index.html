<p>iFilter.js is a JavaScript plugin created by Ryan Davis that allows for creating photo effects right in the
Browser, and in most cases, is nearly instantaneous, however it does pause a bit for a few of the effects, especially on larger images.
To help remedy this, I will be implementing CSS3 filters when they're supported by the browser, and the images 
will be altered and rendered in pieces, to speed up the process in one of the next updates. I may also implement the Blob Api for constructing 
Web Workers on the fly, so that when it does need to take a while to process the image, it doesn't freeze the web page in the meantime.
 It uses the Canvas Api, and therefore is only possible in browsers that support it.
To see a live demo of all the currently available effects, click the <em>Demo</em> tab, and select your desired photo. The GUI is 
highly limited at this time, but in updates that I'll be releasing very soon, will include undo and redo
 capabilities, along with image cropping, image rotation, possibly zooming, and possibly the ability to edit more than one 
 image.  As the development of this project goes on, several new effects are going to be added, and a cross-browser method for invoking a download 
 of the image will be added to the Api.

<p>Sorry, but you won't be able to enjoy this demo right now,
 because your browser doesn't support the technology used here just yet.
 At this time, the only browser that supports <strong>all</strong> everything used in this demo is <em><strong>Google Chrome</strong></em>.
 If you would like to view this demo, I would highly recommend heading over to <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/">Chrome's Download Page</a>, because everything will work
 on Google Chrome, and will work faster than on any other browser, and I also recommend the download just because Chrome is my personal favorite.
